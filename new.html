          After you reach 10,000 miles or one year of ownership, the system will
          tell you it's time for Service A. Each service notification arrives in
          your driver information center roughly 30 days before your Service A
          or B is due.Mercedes-Benz maintenance costs are pretty expensive
          compared to other brands. In one study by YourMechanic.com, it came in
          second place just behind BMW's maintenance costs. Drivers pay about
          $908

          On average per year to maintain and repair their Mercedes vehicles,
          according to RepairPal.com.On average, a Mercedes A Service can cost
          anywhere from $210 to upward of $315 depending on which service
          provider you choose. This price includes labor and parts. No matter
          what, you can expect to spend a couple hundred dollars, which is a
          normal and expected maintenance cost for a luxury automobile like a
          Mercedes.

          do have both of those things). No, Mercedes-Benz makes vehicles that
